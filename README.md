# ClassDictionaries
A Python program uses three dictionaries to store and retrieve information about college courses, including:

Room Number
Instructor Name
Meeting Time

The user is prompted to input a course number (e.g., ECON321). 
The program displays the corresponding room, instructor, and meeting time if the course exists in the system or else it prints "Course not found" message.
